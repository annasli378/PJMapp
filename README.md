<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Due to the size of some of the files that make up the application (such as video content), the application does not contain all the parts, mainly the code itself, so the content will not display properly.

To get a local copy clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/czubamich/BloodDonorCompanionApp.git
   ```
